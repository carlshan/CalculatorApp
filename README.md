# React Native Calculator
Teacher: Carl Shan

This tutorial on how to create a calculator app follows Kyle Banks' [React Native Tutorial](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-1-hello-react) and modifies it for Intro to Mobile App Development, an elective taught to 7th and 8th grade students at the Nueva Middle School in Fall 2017.

## Setup
* First, you should open Terminal and `cd Desktop`.
* Then run `create-react-native-app calculatorapp`
	* This will create a folder called `calculatorapp` on your Desktop.
